# Rehost Overview

> Rehost provides a platform to generalize cloud infrastructure and bring down the complexities. Rehost enables you to develop, ship and run applications as you do on a localmachine without depending on any third-party service. With Rehost, you can manage processes running on any machine of your choice, develop live using hot-reload, and break vendor lock-ins.

## What can I use Rehost for?
### Instant replication of localhost environment

Rehost sets up a tunnel between localhost devices and all of your cloud machines. Our **hot-reload takes 20 seconds**, usually, to reflect changes in your local code live on public URL for quick debugging. This can save you the numerous "minor commits" that sucks the productivity out. Furthermore, with completly docker-based deployments, you can take full control of global packages installed on the machine and not just the dependencies in your codebase.

### Scale across Multiple Cloud Infrastructure

Rehost provides simplified Infrastructure-as-a-Code support to allow quick deployment on any cloud machine. It removes dependency on other cloud services to allow you to break vendor lock-ins. You get **instant public URL and load-balancing** without having to connect to other services.

### Running More Code on the same Machine

Rehost CLI makes it easy for you deploy and go live with just 1 command. Hence, managing multiple processes on the same machine gives you freedom to write custom scripts and deploy without having to bother about the complex cloud management overhead.
